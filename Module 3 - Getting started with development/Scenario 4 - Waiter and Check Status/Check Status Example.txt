		Check status example

Since EC2 commands are asynchronous, one way to make sure the commands 
ran successfully is to check the status of our instance.

import boto3
import time
client = boto3.client('ec2')
client.stop_instances(InstanceIds=['i-027bcd5309696b92f'])
time.sleep(15)

if str(response) == "None":
    print("Instance was stopped successfully!")
else:
    print("Nope! Didn't work!")
