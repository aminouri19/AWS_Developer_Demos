			Waiter Utility Example

In this example, the python code will run the instance stop command
and wait for min 15 seconds for the script to finish. If the script
stops the instance successfully, a "None" response will be sent to
the console.

import boto3
from mypy_boto3_ec2 import waiter
client = boto3.client('ec2')
waiter = client.get_waiter('instance_stopped')
client.stop_instances(InstanceIds=['i-027bcd5309696b92f'])
response = waiter.wait(InstanceIds=['i-027bcd5309696b92f'])
if str(response) == "None":
    print("Instance was stopped successfully!")
else:
    print("Nope! Didn't work!")
