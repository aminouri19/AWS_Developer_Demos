Autostarting an instance after it's been stopped

For this scenario to work we perform the following

1- Create a Python code to start the instance
2- Create an Event Bridge Rules to detect an instance has stopped
3- Create a lambda function to trigger the code to start an instance when an event happens
4- Test it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- To start an instance use the following Python code

import boto3
client = boto3.client('ec2')
response = client.start_instances(InstanceIds=['i-0d19ce488cb88b2ca'])
print(response)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2- Create a lambda function
	1- Open Lmabda
	2- Click Create Function
	3- Select "Author from Scratch"
	4- Call the function name "Start the cool App"
	5- Since your code is a Python App the select "Python 3.9"
	6- Since lambda needs access to EC2, select a lambda role with EC2 access permission
	7- Click "Create Function"
	8- Under the lambda_function tab, paste the code to start the instance

import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # TODO implement
    client = boto3.client('ec2')
    response = client.start_instances(InstanceIds=['i-0d19ce488cb88b2ca'])
    print(response)
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda!')
    }


----------------------------------------------------------

3- To create an Event Bridge rule follow the steps below
	1- Open Event Bridge
	2- Click "Create Rule"
	3- Provide a meaningful name (e.g "Start the cool App")
	4- Select "Event Pattern"
	5- Select "Pre-defined pattern by service"
	6- For "Service Provider", Select "AWS"
	7- For "Service Name" select "EC2"
	8- For "Event Type", select "EC2 instance State-Change Notification"
	9- For specific states, select "Stopped"
	10- "Specific instance id's", paste the instance id

Note: On the right hand side, there is a box called "Event Pattern". Copy the event so 
you can use it when testing the lambda function

	11- Under "select targets", select the lambda function that was create above.
	12- Click the "Create" button

------------------------------------------------

4- To test the process, use the following code
	1- Copy the event pattern from event bridge and have it ready
	2- Open lambda, under "Code Source", Click the down arrow by the "Test" button and select
		the "Configure test event"
	3- Under "Event Name", provide a name for the event (e.g. "Instance Stopped") 
	4- in the event box, paste the event from event bridge pointing the the descired instance
	5- Click "Save" and run the event
