			DynamoDb Data Modeling	


1- Define entities and draw the Entity Relationship Diagram: Define entities and the 
	relationship between them.

2- Identify relationships between entities: One to One/ One to many
	There are five startegies
	1- Denormalization + attribute: This means we can use complex attributes without
	 the need of another table and joins that are common in relational databases
	2- Denormalization + Duplication: For example if you have a column for birthday and 
	 the author has written more than one book, the birthday value will appear as a duplicate
	 for the second item as well. If the data doesn't change like the birthday, this is good strategy.
	3- Composite Primary Key + Query: Place items that have the same primary key on the same table.
	4- Secondary Index + Query: It's a good idea to have attributes that will be used by your application
	 and attributes that will be used by your secondary indexes.
	5- Composite Sort Key: Good if the sort key has a hierarchy

3- Identify Access Methods (Patterns): How should your entities be accessed? 
	list your entitites and find the following about them.
	1- Should you be able to delete, update, read or create an entity.
	2- What aspects of the entity should be accessible to other entities

4- Define the primary key for your entities:

entity    Partition-Key   Sort-Key
------    -------------   --------
Employee       ORG#1         Emp#1
Employee       ORG#1         Emp#2
Organization   ORG#2         Pro#1
