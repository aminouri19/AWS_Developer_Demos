				Schema and Key Design

Why it matters to define the right key?
---------------------------------------
1- It can limit the type of query
2- Possibility of throttling - rejecting your request for not having resources 
   and creating hot partitions


Define Keys
-----------
Primary Key: Is always required. It can be one partition key or one partition key plus a sort key 
Partition key (Hash Key): DynamoDb will store item information in partitions. It uses the key value as an input for the hashing
               function. The output of the hashing function is a location on a Dynamodb partition. When a request 
	       comes in for your key value pair, the hashing function uses the key value as input to generate a hash
	       and use it to find the data in the partition.
Sort Key (Range Key): It can assist to perform better queries by sorting your data on the partition. This means all
	        the data that have the same partition key will be located on the same machine and partition and sorted 
		based on the sort key. The cobination of the partition key and sort key should be unique.

RCU and WCU : Read and write capacity for Dynamodb. This capacity is divided between partitions. If we have 400 RCU's and
	      we have two partitions, each partition will have access to 200 RCU's.

Adaptive Capacity: DynamoDB adaptive capacity makes sure that if one partition is a hot partition and other partitions have
		   have RCU capacity, it can use it for the hot partition.


Summary: 
1- If you need to query based on key details, use the partition key plus sort key primary key
2- If you query only based a key, then just use a partition key as your Primary key
