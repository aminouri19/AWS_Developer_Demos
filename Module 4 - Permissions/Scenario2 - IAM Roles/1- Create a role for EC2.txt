	Create a role for EC2 ans assign Full S3 access permission to the role


1- In this scenario, we first have to create an IAM role that allows the EC2 service 
 to consume it. This is called a trust relationship between the role and service

2- In the second step we have to assign permission to the role. This example will allow
full s3 access to my Ec2 instance.

Note: The important step is that creating the role is an Asynchronous operation, this means
we must make sure the role is created first, then attach the permission to it. To make this
happen we will need to use waiters and implenet them in the code. The waiter will wait till
the role exists and then continue adding the policy.


import boto3
from mypy_boto3_ec2 import waiter
client = boto3.client('iam')
waiter = client.get_waiter('role_exists')
client.create_role(
    Path='/',
    RoleName='Ec2-S3-Access-AM2',
    AssumeRolePolicyDocument='{"Version": "2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect": "Allow","Principal": {"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"},"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"}]}'
)
response = waiter.wait(RoleName='Ec2-S3-Access-AM2')
print(response)
response2 = client.attach_role_policy(
    RoleName='Ec2-S3-Access-AM2', PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess')
print(response2)
